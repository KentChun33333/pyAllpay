## pyAllPay ##
#### == Motivation ==
Because the official SDK of allPay only support programming language such as PHP, C#, .NET and Java.    
Therefore, I'm attempt to implement the SDK in Python for my own project now.
#### == Goal ==
This final goal for this project is to implement the full functionalities of Allpay SDK in Python language.        
#### == Current Status == 
It's built with Django 1.5 and tested to create ATM and CVS (convenience store) payments successfully.        
I still working on it.

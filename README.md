## pyAllPay ##
This project is aimed to implement the full functionality of Allpay SDK in Python.
Cause' The official SDK of allPay only support programming language such as PHP, C#, .NET and Java.
Therefore, I'm trying to implement the SDK in Python for my project now.
It's built with Django 1.5 and tested to create ATM and CVS (convenience store) payments successfully.     
I still working on it.
